- Data Exploration: Dive deep into the datasets (Scats Data, Traffic Count Locations, SCATS Site Listing) to understand the features and identify any data cleaning needed.
- Data Preprocessing: Implement necessary preprocessing steps like handling missing values, data normalization, and feature engineering (as discussed earlier).
- Define Input Format: Specify the predefined format for the traffic flow dataset that your system will use.
- Model Adaptation: Begin adapting the open-source TrafficFlowPrediction project to work with the Boroondara dataset.
- Model Selection: Choose a basic machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees) for initial traffic flow prediction.
- Model Training: Train the selected model on the Boroondara dataset.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).
- Weekly Progress Check: Review our progress with Tuan and make any necessary adjustments plan.
